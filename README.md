# Fabric Mod Template for devOS

## Note: This is the Server-Side Only branch, if you want Client *and* Server side, refer to the Universal branch.

## What is this?

The Minecraft Dev plugin for IntelliJ has been broken for a bit, so I [asoji] just decided to basically grab the FabricExampleMod and make it my own, since I'm getting more than fed up.

Feel free to use it tho.
